        <br />
        <p>
          I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from UFMS and
          gained hands-on experience in Front-end Web Development through an
          internship at Before TI.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Starting as an intern, I quickly progressed to a full-time Front-end
          Developer role, where I am currently employed. I am responsible for
          not only developing and maintaining code, but also leading and
          mentoring the front-end team to deliver high-quality products.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I am passionate about creating visually stunning and user-friendly
          websites and web applications. I have a strong background in VueJS,
          and am always looking to expand my skills and learn new technologies.
